# 👋 Hi, I'm Dinakaran A | Security Researcher & Penetration Tester

🔒 **Offensive Security Specialist | Tool Developer | Bug Bounty Hunter**

---

## 🚀 About Me

I'm an entry-level security researcher and penetration tester with a strong passion for offensive security. My journey into cybersecurity began with a deep curiosity for how systems work and, more importantly, how they can be secured. I'm actively building my expertise in vulnerability research, exploit development, and creating custom tools that enhance the efficiency of security assessments.

### My Primary Focus Areas:

- **🔍 Web Application Penetration Testing**  
  I actively engage in uncovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, ranging from common OWASP Top 10 issues to more intricate business logic flaws. My goal is to identify critical weaknesses before malicious actors can.

- **🤖 Developing Automation Tools for Security Research**  
  I believe in the power of automation to streamline repetitive tasks and uncover hidden attack surfaces. I develop custom scripts and tools to automate reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploit development.

- **🐛 Hunting Bugs in Bug Bounty Programs**  
  As an enthusiastic bug bounty hunter, I participate in public and private programs, searching for vulnerabilities in real-world applications to make the internet safer.

- **🔴 Exploring Red Teaming Concepts**  
  I'm learning red teaming methodologies, focusing on simulating real-world adversarial attacks to test security postures.

- **📚 Sharing Knowledge**  
  I'm committed to continuous learning and sharing findings with the security community through write-ups and open-source contributions.

I'm a proactive learner, constantly exploring new attack vectors and defense mechanisms, eager to take on new challenges in security.
