## üöÄ About Me

I'm an entry-level security researcher and penetration tester with a strong passion for offensive security. My journey into cybersecurity began with a deep curiosity for how systems work and, more importantly, how they can be secured. I'm actively building my expertise in vulnerability research, exploit development, and creating custom tools that enhance the efficiency of security assessments.

My primary focus areas include:

üîç Web Application Penetration Testing: I actively engage in uncovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, ranging from common OWASP Top 10 issues to more intricate business logic flaws. My goal is to identify critical weaknesses before malicious actors can.
ü§ñ Developing Automation Tools for Security Research: I believe in the power of automation to streamline repetitive tasks and uncover hidden attack surfaces. I develop custom scripts and tools, like those listed below, to automate reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploit development, making the security process more efficient and effective.
üêõ Hunting Bugs in Bug Bounty Programs: As an enthusiastic bug bounty hunter, I actively participate in public and private programs, meticulously searching for vulnerabilities in real-world applications. This hands-on experience allows me to hone my skills in diverse environments and contribute to making the internet a safer place. I'm driven by the thrill of discovery and the satisfaction of reporting impactful findings.
üî¥ Exploring Red Teaming Concepts: I'm keenly interested in red teaming methodologies, focusing on simulating real-world adversarial attacks to test an organization's overall security posture. While I'm at an entry level, I'm actively learning and practicing techniques related to initial access, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, aiming to develop a holistic understanding of offensive operations.
üìö Sharing Knowledge and Contributing to the Community: I'm committed to continuous learning and sharing my findings with the broader security community. I regularly publish detailed write-ups of vulnerabilities I've discovered and contribute to open-source security projects, believing that collaboration and knowledge exchange are vital for collective growth.
I am a proactive learner, constantly exploring new attack vectors and defense mechanisms. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and contribute my skills to impactful security initiatives.
